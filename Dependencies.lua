	If you're adding a new dependency all you have to do to get it linking
	and included is define it properly in the table below, here's some example usage:

	MyDepName = {
		LibName = "my_dep_name",
		LibDir = "some_path_to_dependency_lib_dir",
		IncludeDir = "my_include_dir",
		Windows = { DebugLibName = "my_dep_name_debug" },
		Configurations = "Debug,Release"
	}

	MyDepName - This is just for organizational purposes, it doesn't actually matter for the build process
	LibName - This is the name of the .lib file that you want e.g Hazelnut to link against (you shouldn't include the .lib extension since Linux uses .a)
	LibDir - Indicates which directory the lib file is located in, this can include "%{cfg.buildcfg}" if you have a dedicated Debug / Release directory
	IncludeDir - Pretty self explanatory, the filepath that will be included in externalincludedirs
	Windows - This defines a platform-specific scope for this dependency, anything defined in that scope will only apply for Windows, you can also add one for Linux
	DebugLibName - Use this if the .lib file has a different name in Debug builds (e.g "shaderc_sharedd" vs "shaderc_shared")
	Configurations - Defines a list of configurations that this dependency should be used in, if no Configurations is specified all configs will link and include this dependency (which is what we want in most cases)

	Most of the properties I've listed can be used in either the "global" dependency scope OR in a specific platform scope,
	the only property that doesn't support that is "Configurations" which HAS to be defined in the global scope.

	Of course you can put only SOME properties in a platform scope, and others in the global scope if you want to.

	Naturally I suggest taking a look at existing dependency definitions when adding a new dependency.

	Remember that in most cases you only need to update this list, no need to manually add dependencies to the "links" list or "includedirs" list

	HEADER-ONLY LIBRARIES: If your dependency is header-only you shouldn't specify e.g LibName, just add IncludeDir and it'll be treated like a header-only library
